\chapter{Conclusions and recommendations}
\label{chap:conclusions}
This chapter consists of two sections.
\section{Conclusions}
The conclusions should directly answer the research question that was formulated in Chapter~\ref{chap:introduction}, or state to what extent the research goal has been achieved. This is what distinguishes the conclusion from the summary: it should \emph{not} summarize the \emph{contents} of the preceding chapters, but rather only what should be \emph{concluded} from them. 

Dedicate one paragraph to each seperate conclusion.

\section{Recommendations}
The recommendations basically answer two questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item How could the presentated research be improved if it were repeated?
\item What would be the appropriate question(s) for future research starting from what is presented here?  
\end{enumerate} 
Dedicate one paragraph to each seperate recommendation, and clearly distinguish between the two types of recommendations.
