\pagestyle{headings}

The preface is optional. It contains anything that is outside the actual scope of the report, for instance
\begin{itemize}
	\item how you ended up doing the assignment that is reported in this document;
	\item your personal opinion on the subject;
	\item an acknowledgment to the people that helped you carrying out the work.
\end{itemize}
Alternatively an epilogue or acknowledgment chapter could be included in the backmatter of the report.
