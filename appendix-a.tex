\chapter{Background of First User Study}

%Anything that does not directly contribute to the understanding for the reader, but is still relevant in order to support particular claims made in the report (for instance a purely mathematical derivation), should be put in the appendix. (That is, only if it cannot be found elsewhere. Otherwise a simple citation suffices.)

%For the rest the appendices are like the other chapters, i.e. they can have sections, figures, tables, and citations (even though the appendix comes after the list of references).
