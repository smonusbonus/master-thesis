We can explain this contrast if we think in terms of the increased start-up costs and delayed gratification associated with adopting a {VCS}. We humans typically discount the future, and therefore implementing version control in a project appears to be a fight against human nature. It's true that you can't beat the productivity boost that compilers and editors provide, but four decades after punched-card programming in assembly language has gone out of fashion, we must now look elsewhere for our next efficiency gains. And if you or your project isn't using a {VCS}, adopting one might well be the single most important tooling improvement you can undertake.},

Yet this hypothesis has not been systematically explored by researchers, and conceptual design has not played the central role in the research and teaching of software engineering that one might expect. As part of a new research project to explore conceptual design, we are engaging in a series of case studies. This paper reports on the early stages of our first study, on the Git version control system. Despite its widespread adoption, Git puzzles even experienced developers and is not regarded as easy to use. In an attempt to understand the root causes of its complexity, we analyze its conceptual model and identify some undesirable properties; we then propose a reworking of the conceptual model that forms the basis of (the first version of) Gitless, an ongoing effort to redesign Git and experiment with the effects of conceptual simplifications.},

And since then, they have been improved with many features and easy-to-use user interfaces. In this paper, we propose a new feature to be implemented into commonly used version control systems, such as {CVS} and {SubVersion}. This feature promotes real time collaboration, opening the door towards a social interaction among development team members. This interaction allows software developers to communicate more effectively through an internal social networking site within the context of the version control environment. The new feature demonstrates that it can be effectively utilized to avoid conflicts, which is one of the major challenges not only in version control, but in any collaborative system.},

	abstract = {An ongoing problem in revision control systems is how to resolve conflicts in a merge of independently developed revisions. Unstructured revision control systems are purely text-based and solve conflicts based on textual similarity. Structured revision control systems are tailored to specific languages and use language-specific knowledge for conflict resolution. We propose semistructured revision control systems that inherit the strengths of both: the generality of unstructured systems and the expressiveness of structured systems. The idea is to provide structural information of the underlying software artifacts --- declaratively, in the form of annotated grammars. This way, a wide variety of languages can be supported and the information provided can assist in the automatic resolution of two classes of conflicts: ordering conflicts and semantic conflicts. The former can be resolved independently of the language and the latter using specific conflict handlers. We have been developing a tool that supports semistructured merge and conducted an empirical study on 24 software projects developed in Java, C\#, and Python comprising 180 merge scenarios. We found that semistructured merge reduces the number of conflicts in 60\% of the sample merge scenarios by, on average, 34\%, compared to unstructured merge. We found also that renaming is challenging in that it can increase the number of conflicts during semistructured merge, and that a combination of unstructured and semistructured merge is a pragmatic way to go.},

	abstract = {Merge conflicts cause software defects which if detected late may require expensive resolution. This is especially true when developers work too long without integrating concurrent changes, which in practice is common as integration generally occurs at check-in. Awareness of others' activities was proposed to help developers detect conflicts earlier. However, it requires developers to detect conflicts by themselves and may overload them with notifications, thus making detection harder. This paper presents a novel solution that continuously merges uncommitted and committed changes to create a background system that is analyzed, compiled, and tested to precisely and accurately detect conflicts on behalf of developers, before check-in. An empirical study confirms that our solution avoids overloading developers and improves early detection of conflicts over existing approaches. Similarly to what happened with continuous compilation, this introduces the case for continuous merging inside the {IDE}.},

We consider here a common manifestation of simplicity: the assumption that the objects in a wiki that can be edited (e.g., Wikipedia articles) are relatively independent. As wiki applications in new domains emerge, however, this assumption is no longer tenable. In wikis where the objects of interest are highly interdependent (e.g., geographic wikis), fundamental concepts like the revision and undoing must be refined. This is particularly so when fine-grained access control is required (as in enterprise wikis or wikis to support collaboration between citizens and government officials). We explore these issues in the context of the Cyclopath geowiki and present solutions that we have designed and have implemented or are implementing.},

With an intention to adapt the advanced revision control technologies and practices to the conditions of the Web, the paper reconsiders some obsolete assumptions and develops a new versioned text format perfectly processable with standard regular expressions ({PCRE} [6]). The resulting deep hypertext model allows instant access to past/concurrent versions, authorship, changes; enables deep links to reference changing parts of a changing text. Effectively, it allows distributed and real-time revision control on the Web, implementing the vision of co-evolution and mutation exchange among multiple competing versions of the same text.},

	abstract = {Revision control is a vital component of digital project management and has been widely deployed for text files. Binary files, on the other hand, have received relatively less attention. This can be in-convenient for graphics applications that use a significant amount of binary data, such as images, videos, meshes, and animations. Exist-ing strategies such as storing whole files for individual revisions or simple binary deltas could consume significant storage and obscure vital semantic information. We present a nonlinear revision con-trol system for images, designed with the common digital editing and sketching workflows in mind. We use {DAG} (directed acyclic graph) as the core structure, with {DAG} nodes representing editing operations and {DAG} edges the corresponding spatial, temporal and semantic relationships. We visualize our {DAG} in {RevG} (revision graph), which provides not only as a meaningful display of the re-vision history but also an intuitive interface for common revision control operations such as review, replay, diff, addition, branch-ing, merging, and conflict resolving. Beyond revision control, our system also facilitates artistic creation processes in common image editing and digital painting workflows. We have built a prototype system upon {GIMP}, an open source image editor, and demonstrate its effectiveness through formative user study and comparisons with alternative revision control systems.},

It provides the scientific and theoretical basis required by industrial and academic researchers, as well as the practical and methodological guidance needed by practitioners who face problems of building safe and effective human-technology systems.Fundamental across a wide range of disciplines, from military systems to consumer goods and process industries, cognitive task design covers the whole life-cycle of work from pre-analysis, specification, design, risk assessment, implementation, training, daily operation, fault finding, maintenance, and upgrading. It applies to people, sophisticated machines, and to human-machine ensembles. This comprehensive volume summarizes the extensive, worldwide experience with cognitive task design since the 1980s; it defines the state of the art and outlines the future of this ever-developing field.Aimed at the graduate and postgraduate level, the Handbook of Cognitive Task Design is applicable to courses relating to the design of human-technology systems, interaction design, cognitive engineering, and applied industrial engineering.},

I strive to show that tutorial {CALL} and computer-mediated communication can complement each other in the service of modern language instruction, along with the inclusion of language games. Although assessment studies of {OLL} remain sparse, the evidence is steadily mounting that shows that these new formats can provide learning environments conducive to successful second language development when properly integrated into the curriculum.},

Observing the User Experience will help you bridge that gap to understand what your users want and need from your product, and whether they'll be able to use what you've created. Filled with real-world experience and a wealth of practical information, this book presents a complete toolbox of techniques to help designers and developers see through the eyes of their users. It provides in-depth coverage of 13 user experience research techniques that will provide a basis for developing better products, whether they're Web, software or mobile based. In addition, it's written with an understanding of product development in the real world, taking tight budgets, short schedules, and existing processes into account. Since the publication of the first edition, the business of user research has exploded with new technologies and new techniques. This second edition takes those changes into account with extensive revisions to existing topics. It also adds entirely new material on observational research, mobile usability, diary studies, remote research, and cross-cultural and multilingual projects. Explains how to balance usability with creativity and {originalityA} valuable resource for designers, developers, project managers -- anyone whose work affects the end user {experienceProvides} a real-world perspective on research.
